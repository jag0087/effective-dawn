__Abstract__  
This project establishes a virtualized cybersecurity laboratory built to align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 Rev. 5 security controls and the Risk Management Framework (RMF). The goal of the lab is to simulate a small but realistic enterprise environment to demonstrate the implementation and documentation of key NIST control families, including Access Control (AC), Identification and Authentication (IA), Configuration Management (CM), Audit and Accountability (AU), and Incident Response (IR).  
The environment consists of both Windows and Linux systems deployed within VMware Workstation on a local workstation. Each component will serve as evidence of security control implementation, supported by documentation artifacts such as a System Security Plan (SSP), a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), and Request for Information (RFI) response examples. The project aims to provide practical experience with control documentation, system hardening, and audit evidence collection.

**Introduction**  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a series of frameworks and publications that form the foundation for information security governance within both public and private sector organizations. Among these, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 outlines a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls used to protect information systems.  
The objective of this project is to design and deploy a controlled virtual environment that allows for the practical implementation and documentation of selected NIST SP 800-53 controls. This laboratory will replicate common enterprise infrastructure components. Components such as a domain controller, client systems, servers, and logging mechanisms, while maintaining manageability on a single workstation.  
All information in this lab should be considered open to the public for use, training, and reproducibility. Constructive feedback or correction is welcomed.

By the end of this project, the environment will enable the user to:  
Understand the intent and application of NIST SP 800-53 controls.  
Implement technical measures that satisfy control requirements.  
Collect verifiable evidence to support compliance documentation.  
Produce professional artifacts (SSP, POA&M, and RFI) that demonstrate applied cybersecurity governance.

**Methodology**  
The lab will be implemented following these key stages:  
1. System Deployment:  
Configure virtual machines and establish the virtual network.

2. Control Implementation:  
Apply security configurations to demonstrate conformance with selected NIST SP 800-53 controls, such as MFA enforcement, centralized logging, and account lifecycle management.

3. Documentation Creation:  
Develop an SSP outlining system boundaries and implemented controls, a POA&M listing identified weaknesses, and RFI-style evidence responses.

4. Evidence Collection:  
Capture timestamped screenshots, configuration files, and exported logs mapped to specific control IDs.

5. Evaluation and Reporting:  
Review implemented controls against baseline expectations and produce a final report summarizing results and lessons learned.
